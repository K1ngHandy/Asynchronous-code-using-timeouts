    PROBLEM 4: Write a function called countdown that takes a number as a parameter and uses setInterval and clearInterval to count down from that number to 0, logging each number to the console. Call the function with a number of your choice.

    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): The code below should log a message to the console every 2 seconds, starting from 0 and going up to 10. However, the code below does not function properly. Console.log the count function to see the error message and fix the code so that the correct results print to the console.
        function count() {
  for (var i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
    setTimeout(function() {
      console.log(i);

}
    */
   //Due to the asynchronous nature of setTimeout, the value of i in the callback function will always be 11, because by the time the function is executed, the loop has already finished and the value of i has been incremented to 11. To fix this, you can wrap a function that will execute around the setTimeout function to capture the value of i at each iteration. 
    function count() {
        for (var i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
          (function (i) {
            setTimeout(function () {
              console.log(i);
            }, i * 2000);
          })(i);
        }
      }

      count();
